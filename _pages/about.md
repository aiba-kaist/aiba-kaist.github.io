Welcome to the **AI & Business Analytics (AIBA) Lab** at KAIST College of Business (School of Management Engineering), led by **Associate Professor Donghyuk Shin**.

We combine AI and business analytics to empirically analyze the economic and social value of artificial intelligence. Our research lies at the intersection of **artificial intelligence** and **information systems**. Topics of interest include artificial intelligence, digital platforms, educational technology, and their business and societal impacts. We use ML, econometric analysis, and randomized field experiments.

## Research Areas

**Economics of AI/IT**
- Analyzing the economic impact of AI and IT technologies on business and society
- Causal inference, field experiments, and platform economics

**AI/ML Applications**
- Business applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning
- LLM simulation, generative AI, and human-AI interaction

**Digital Platforms**
- Research on digital platforms, social media ecosystems, and online communities
- Misinformation, content moderation, and platform dynamics
